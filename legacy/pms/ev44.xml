<!--
   This element indicates the consistency of the data elements because of incorporated
   processing, windowing or burnt-in graphics. A data element becomes inconsistent if its
   value incorporates a value (or reference to a value) which has been changed while the data
   element itself has not been changed or deleted. Updating or deleting such data elements
   cannot be done if the data element is a free formatted data element or other than a standard
   data element.
  The generic format of the multiple values of this text element is: <free text> | `$'<enumer-
  ated text>. The first value is a global indication of the consistency and the following enu-
  meration are defined for it:
  *`$unknown': This is the default value.
  *`$normal': Normal consistency.
  *`$limited': Possibly limited consistency.
  The other (second etc.) values of this element give detailed consistency information and are
  not specified in this Statement.

<entry group="0019" element="YY25" name="Original Pixel Data Quality" vr="LO" vm="1-n"/>
<!--
  This element indicates that the quality of the original pixel data is limited because of one
  reason or another. The generic format and enumerated values are the same as for private ele-
  ment 0009, YY04 Image Data Consistence.
-->
<entry group="0029" element="YY25" name="Processed Pixel Data Quality" vr="LO" vm="1-n"/>
<!--
  This element indicates that the quality of the processed pixel data is limited because of
  incorporated processing, windowing or burnt in graphics. The first value summarizes the
  quality. Each subsequent value identifies one aspects which contributes to the quality, in
  order of occurrence. The generic format and enumerated values are the same as for private
  element 0009, YY04 Image Data Consistence.

<!--
* A private group with group number 7FE1 can be available to store non standard pixel data
  behind the 7FE0 group which contains the standard pixel data.
